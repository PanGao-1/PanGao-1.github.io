### My name

    &nbsp;&nbsp;I am a second-year Ph.D. student, **Gao Pan**. 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am enrolled at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).
    &nbsp;&nbsp;My research interest includes computer vision, multi-modal fusion, and 3D object detection.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ping Zhang](https://sose.uestc.edu.cn/info/1184/7985.htm) from [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).
